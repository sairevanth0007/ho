// Description: Initiates Google OAuth login flow.
// This Zest file primarily acts as a documentation/shortcut for the OAuth flow.
// The actual login involves browser redirects and cannot be fully automated by Zest alone.
// You would manually click the OAuth link to trigger the flow and capture the session cookie.
// After successful OAuth, you can use the 'get_profile.zest' to verify login.
